<h1> The <tt>iopause</tt> library interface </h1>

<p>
 The following functions are declared in the <tt>skalibs/iopause.h</tt> header,
and implemented in the <tt>libskarnet.a</tt> or <tt>libskarnet.so</tt> library.
</p>

<h2> General information </h2>

<p>
 <tt>iopause</tt> is the skalibs API for event loop selection. It's a
wrapper around the system's
<a href="http://www.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/functions/poll.html">poll()</a>
(if available) or
<a href="http://www.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/functions/select.html">select()</a>
(if <tt>poll()</tt> is unavailable) function. It
works around some system-dependent quirks; also it works with
<em>absolute dates</em> instead of timeouts. This is a good thing:
see below.
</p>

<p>
 <tt>iopause</tt> is a derived work from Dan J. Bernstein's
<a href="http://cr.yp.to/lib/iopause.html">iopause</a> library, but the
skalibs implementation is subtly different.
</p>

<h2> Data structures </h2>

<p>
 An <tt>iopause_fd</tt> structure is similar to a
<a href="http://www.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/basedefs/poll.h.html">struct pollfd</a>
structure, and must be filled the same way. Usually, the user declares
an array of <tt>iopause_fd</tt> and fills it, one element per descriptor
to select on. If <em>x</em> is an <tt>iopause_fd</tt>:
</p>

<ul>
 <li> <em>x</em>.fd must be set to the fd number to select on. </li>
 <li> <em>x</em>.events must be a disjunction of the following flags:
 <ul>
  <li> IOPAUSE_READ if the fd is to be selected for reading. </li>
  <li> IOPAUSE_WRITE if the fd is to be selected for writing. </li>
 </ul> </li>
 <li> When the selection function returns, <em>x</em>.revents contains
a disjunction of the following flags:
 <ul>
  <li> IOPAUSE_READ if the fd is readable (this include reception of an EOF). </li>
  <li> IOPAUSE_WRITE if the fd is writable. </li>
  <li> IOPAUSE_EXCEPT if an exception (such as EOF or an error) occurred on the fd. </li>
 </ul> </li>
</ul>

<p>
 Unlike <tt>poll()</tt> or <tt>select()</tt>, which use a <em>timeout</em>
argument, the <tt>iopause()</tt> function uses a <em>deadline</em> argument,
i.e. an absolute time at which it must return 0 if no event has happened
so far, as well as a <em>stamp</em> argument, i.e. an absolute time meaning
<em>now</em>. Those arguments are stored in
<a href="tai.html">tain_t</a>s. Here is why:
</p>

<p>
 The event loop pattern is mostly used to multiplex several asynchronous
events that can happen independently, at the same time or not. Let's
say you have 3 events, <em>x</em>, <em>y</em> and <em>z</em>. Each of
those has a separate timeout: if <em>x</em> happens before <em>x-timeout</em>
milliseconds, you call the <em>x-event-handler</em> function, but
if <em>x-timeout</em> milliseconds elapse without <em>x</em> happening,
you call <em>x-timeout-handler</em> function. And similarly with <em>y</em>
and <em>z</em>.
</p>

<p>
 But the selection function returning does not mean <em>x</em> has happened
or that <em>x</em> has timed out. It might also mean that <em>y</em> has
happened, that <em>y</em> has timed out, that <em>z</em> has happened, that
<em>z</em> has timed out, or something else entirely. In the post-selection
part of the loop, the proper handler is called for the event or timeout
that has happened; then the loop is executed again, and in the
pre-selection part of the loop, the array describing the events is filled,
and the selection timeout is computed.
</p>

<p>
 How are you going to compute that global selection timeout? Easy: it's the
shortest of the three. But we just spent some amount of time waiting, so the
individual timeouts must be recomputed! This means:
<ul>
 <li> You need a way to know the time spent in a selection primitive, which
basically means getting a timestamp before the selection and once again
after the timestamp. </li>
 <li> You need to recompute every individual timeout everytime you enter
the loop. </li>
</ul>

<p>
 That is really cumbersome. A much simpler way of doing things is:
</p>

<ul>
 <li> Always keep a reasonably accurate estimation of the current
time in a <em>stamp</em> variable. That means getting the current time
at the start of the process, and updating it <em>right after</em> any
action that takes a significant amount of time. When to update <em>stamp</em>
can be difficult to estimate in CPU-bound processes; fortunately, most
processes using an event loop are IO-bound, and the only actions that take
a non-negligible amount of time in an IO-bound process are the blocking
primitives. So, <em>stamp</em> must be updated <em>right after a selection
function returns</em>, and if the program has been correctly written and
cannot block anywhere else, it's the only place where it needs to be. </li>
 <li> For every event, compute the <em>deadline</em> of that event:
<em>x-deadline</em> is <em>x-timeout</em> added to the current <em>stamp</em>
value when <em>x</em> enters the loop. This is done only once per event:
you never have to recompute event deadlines - unlike timeouts, which diminish
over time, deadlines do not change. </li>
 <li> At every iteration, the selection deadline is the earliest of all the
available event deadlines. </li>
 <li> As an added bonus: after the selection function returns and
 <em>stamp</em> has been updated, it is easy to check which events have
timed out and which have not: <em>x</em> has timed out iff <em>x-deadline</em>
is earlier than <em>stamp</em>. </li>
</ul>

<p>
 Maintaining a global timestamp and using absolute times instead of relative
times really is the right way to work with event loops, and the <tt>iopause</tt>
interface reflects that. Of course, you need a reliable, bug-free time library
and a monotonic, constant system clock to handle absolute times correctly;
that is why <tt>iopause</tt> relies on the <a href="tai.html">tai</a> library.
</p>

<h2> Functions </h2>

<p>
<code> int iopause (iopause_fd *x, unsigned int len, tain_t const *deadline, tain_t const *stamp) </code> <br />
Blocks until one of the events described in the <em>x</em> array, of length
<em>len</em>, happens, or until the absolute date *<em>deadline</em> is
reached. <em>deadline</em> may be null, in which case the function blocks
indefinitely until an event happens. If <em>deadline</em> is not null, then
<em>stamp</em> must not be null, and must contain an accurate estimation
of the current time. The function returns the number of events that have
happened, 0 for a timeout, or -1 (and sets errno) for an error.
</p>

<p>
<code> int iopause_stamp (iopause_fd *x, unsigned int len, tain_t const *deadline, tain_t *stamp) </code> <br />
Like <tt>iopause()</tt>, but if <em>stamp</em> is not null, it is updated
right before the function returns. This helps the user always keep a
reasonably accurate estimation of the current time in <em>stamp</em>;
it is recommended to use this function instead of the lower-level
<tt>iopause()</tt>.
</p>

<h3> Underlying implementations </h3>

<p>
 <tt>iopause</tt> is an alias to either <tt>iopause_poll</tt> or
or <tt>iopause_select</tt>. By default, it is aliased to <tt>iopause_poll</tt>; to
alias it to <tt>iopause_select</tt> instead, configure skalibs with the
<tt>--enable-iopause-select</tt> option.
</p>

<p>
Both <tt>iopause_poll</tt> and <tt>iopause_select</tt> are implemented on top of the
<a href="http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/ppoll.2.html">ppoll()</a> system call
if it is available; but if it is not, then <tt>iopause_poll</tt> defaults to
<a href="http://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/functions/poll.html">poll()</a>,
which has a more comfortable API than
<a href="http://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/functions/select.html">select()</a>,
but a maximum precision of 1 millisecond which might not be enough for some applications; whereas
<tt>iopause_select</tt> defaults to select(), which incurs some CPU overhead for the
API conversion, but has a 1 microsecond precision.
