<h1> How to cross-compile skalibs </h1>

<p>
 There are three issues in the world of cross-compilation:
</p>

<ul>
 <li> support for parallel builds: the source directory must be read-only
and each build process must have its own build tree. </li>
 <li> support for compiler options: to specify the target architecture,
the header and library files that should be used, etc.
 <li> build-time tests performed on the build architecture are invalid
if the target architecture is different. </li>
</ul>

<h2> Support for parallel builds </h2>

<p>
 skalibs does not support out-of-tree builds at the moment,
but since the source code tree is small, it's not costly to duplicate it
to perform parallel builds. If the source code tree grows significantly
larger, out-of-tree build support will be considered.
</p>

<h3> Support for staging </h3>

<p>
 The skalibs Makefile, as well as every other
<a href="//skarnet.org/software/">skarnet.org package</a>'s
Makefile, supports the DESTDIR convention for staging. To install
skalibs under a <em>stage</em> fake root:
</p>

<ul>
 <li> Give the options you need to <tt>./configure</tt>.
The arguments to the <tt>--prefix</tt>, <tt>--libdir</tt> and similar
options must be the valid paths for <strong>run-time</strong>. </li>
 <li> To install the software, run <tt>make install
DESTDIR=<em>stage</em></tt>. </li>
</ul>

<h2> Support for build-time options and bypassing target execution tests </h2>

<p>
 skalibs uses a standard <tt>./configure &amp;&amp; make &amp;&amp; make install</tt>
process, and cross-compiling build-time options can be given on the
<tt>./configure</tt> command line.
</p>

<p>
 skalibs performs a certain number of build-time tests, to collect
behaviour information on the target architecture. Most of these tests
work when cross-compiling, because they only involve characteristics
of the target that the cross-toolchain knows at build time; but some
actually require code execution on the target, and so they cannot be
performed when cross-compiling. For those, you have to manually
give a special option to configure, to tell the build system what the
behaviour of the target architecture is. The option is of the form
<tt>--with-sysdep-<em>key</em>=<em>value</em></tt>, where <em>key</em>
is the name of the sysdep (i.e. the element of target behaviour that
is being tested), and <em>value</em> the associated value, most of
the time <tt>yes</tt> or <tt>no</tt>.
</p>

<p>
 At all times, <tt>./configure --help</tt> provides the list of sysdeps
you need to provide a <tt>--with-sysdep-*</tt> option for. As of
skalibs-2.14.0.1, there are two sysdeps in this case:
</p>

<ul>
 <li> <tt>devurandom</tt>: <tt>yes</tt> if the target has a valid
pseudorandom generation device in <tt>/dev/urandom</tt>, and <tt>no</tt>
otherwise. </li>
 <li> <tt>posixspawnearlyreturn</tt>: <tt>yes</tt> if the target has a broken
<a href="https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9799919799/functions/posix_spawn.html">posix_spawn()</a>
implementation that can return before the child has successfully exec'ed.
That happens with old glibcs and some virtual platforms. </li>
</ul>
