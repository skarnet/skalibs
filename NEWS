In 2.8.0.0
----------

 - avltreeb removed. (It used VLAs inside of structures, which is
GNU C, not C99.) The AVLTREEN_DECLARE_AND_INIT() macro should be
used instead.
 - New functions: env_dump(), mk?temp(), autosurf(), autosurf_name()
 - mkdir_unique() removed. (Duplicate functionality with mkdtemp.)
 - ancilautoclose and nbwaitall sysdeps removed.
 - New header: skalibs/posixishard.h
 - Static libraries are now PIC by default.


In 2.7.0.0
----------

 - Bugfixes.
 - New functions: ipc_timed_sendv(), unlink_void(), genset_deepfree(),
gensetdyn_deepfree(), skagetln_loose(), skagetlnsep_loose()
 - dir_close() now returns void and leaves errno unchanged
 - absolutepath(), sarealpath_tmp(), avl*_deletnode(), mininetstring, prot functions removed
 - djbunix.h doesn't include env.h anymore


In 2.6.4.0
----------

 - Bugfixes.
 - New functions: execvep_loose(), byte_zzero(), openb_read(), sig0_scan()
 - New function family: skalibs/genqdyn.h


In 2.6.3.1
----------

 - Bugfixes.


In 2.6.3.0
----------

 - New dir_fd function wrapping dirfd() (Solaris doesn't have dirfd())
 - memmem implementation for platforms that don't provide it.
 - memmem wrappers: byte_search, siovec_search.
 - New functions: atomic_symlink, skagetlnmaxsep, child_spawn3
 - New header: skalibs/posixplz.h, some header reorganization.
 - New family of functions: textmessage and textclient
 - skalibs/environ.h and skalibs/getpeereid.h are now obsolescent.
 - Bugfixes.


In 2.6.2.0
----------

 - New functions: access_at() (MacOS and Solaris don't support faccessat),
skaclient_timed_aflush().
 - stralloc.h and tai.h are suitable for inclusion in C++ headers.
 - New sysdep: SKALIBS_HASODIRECTORY. (MacOS doesn't support O_DIRECTORY.)


In 2.6.1.0
----------

 - New function: lock_unx().


In 2.6.0.2
----------

 - Bugfixes.
 - Optimized packing/unpacking routines.


In 2.6.0.1
----------

 - Better CPPFLAGS/CFLAGS/LDFLAGS management.
 - openwritenclose() and openwritevnclose() now use mkstemp.


In 2.6.0.0
----------

 - Bugfixes.
 - New unixmessage_receiver_hasmsginbuf() function to address an issue
in unixmessage_handle().
 - fd_close() now returns void. This mandates a major version bump.
 - new skalibs_setgroups(), setgroups_with_egid() and setgroups_and_gid()
functions to work around supplementary group mismanagement in... can you
guess what operating system? (You get 3 tries. One for each BSD.)


In 2.5.1.1
----------

 - Bugfixes.


In 2.5.1.0
----------

 - Bugfixes.
 - More workarounds for OpenBSD (who else).
 - More workarounds for sysdeps detection by broken toolchains.
 - Added the xpathexec_* family of functions (in djbunix.h).


In 2.5.0.0
----------

 - Added this NEWS file. :)
 - Dropped support for old versions of OpenBSD (at least 4.9 isn't working
anymore). Newer versions are still supported: 5.7 and up are working.
 - --enable-replace-libc flag dropped. All supported systems now have a
compliant-enough libc for skalibs' purposes.
 - Major types overhaul to be more POSIXly correct. 64-bit operations are
now supported on 64-bit archs where int is 32-bit. Use of POSIX types
wherever important, e.g. where pointers are used: datastruct.h indices,
for instance, are uint32_t. stralloc et al. lengths are size_t.
 - Related API changes: skalibs/ushort.h, skalibs/uint.h and skalibs/ulong.h
have disappeared - replaced with skalibs/types.h that also includes basic
fmtscan support for common POSIX types. The uint16, uint32 and uint64
integer types have disappeared - replaced with stdint.h types. uint64_t is
defined by skalibs/uint64.h when stdint.h omits it.
 - Lots of minor bugfixes and cleanups related to the types system.
 - Better support for getrandom() and arc4random().
